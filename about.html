        <h2>About the Podcast</h2>
        <p>This podcast focuses on human interaction with the natural world. First, we address 
            monarch butterfly decline and endangerment, which is representative of the global biodiversity crisis. 
            Next, this topic is covered from a broader perspective, diving into the ways our choices and actions have an impact 
            on our surroundings. We also explore the career of environmental law. Finally, we touch on how research is a 
            valuable way to gain knowledge, and English 105 students reflect on their experiences disseminating information 
            in a podcast format. Listen now if you are interested in the world around you! 
            Or maybe butterflies are your favorite animalâ€¦</p>

        <h2>About the Podcaster</h2>
        <p>Hi, as you may know, I am Katie Jorczak. Thank you again for stopping 
            by. I wanted to take the time to share a little bit more about myself and give all of my 
            listeners the opportunity to get to know me a little bit better.</p>
        <p>I was born Torrance, California but currently live in Palos Verdes, California. I spent all most of my 
            life there until it came time to go to college. I decided to try something new and go to school on the east coast. The 
            University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill gave me the opportunity to do just that. I am currently pursuing pre-business 
            at UNC but I have a strong interest in environmental studies.</p>
        <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
        <p>I have been riding horses since I was 6 years old</p>
        <p>My favorite fruit is watermelon</p>
        <p>My top 5 vegetables are as follows: sweet potatoes, kale, snap peas, broccoli, and brussel sprouts</p>
        <p>I have a pet ghost named Terry - his cousin is named Lawrence</p>
        <p>I used to have a rabbit named Star</p>
        <p>My family has a functioning garden in our backyard that we like to maintain and grow food from - especially milkweed</p>
